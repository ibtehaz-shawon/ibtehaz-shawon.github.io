# Interesting-Links  This repositories will contain interesting link(s) I find throughout each day. I will try to add some description, describing their purposes and etc.   The main purpose of this repo is to contain information about the links. I often found bookmarks tab filled in a day/week (at max) and I (probably you too), check the overflowed bookmarks just to find what's in there. After all, &lt;i> we have fast internet connection, right? &lt;/i>   &lt;b> peace &lt;/b>
